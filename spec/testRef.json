The model incorporates a 17,000 house database developed using the latest data available from the EnerGuide for Houses database, Statistics Canada housing surveys, and other available housing databases. The geometry and thermal envelope of each house is defined in detail, making it suitable for energy simulation based on engineering methods (thermodynamics and heat transfer). The model utilizes the ESP-r building energy simulation program as its simulation engine. To account for effects due to occupant behaviour, a new neural network methodology is utilized to estimate the demographic dependencies of the annual energy consumption of discretionary end-uses such as appliances, lighting and domestic hot water. A new approach is used to allot the annual energy consumption of discretionary end-uses to hourly or sub-hourly intervals based on occupancy, appliance, lighting and domestic hot water load profiles. Each house’s profiles are incorporated into the model as loads, a portion of which becomes internal heat gain for inclusion in the space heating/cooling simulation conducted using ESP-r. A new method is used to calculate the GHG emissions from electricity consumption used in the residential sector based on the actual electrical generation fuel mix and the marginal fuel used in each province as a function of the time of year. The developing hybrid model will predict energy consumption and GHG emissions of the CHS based on the latest available stock databases and surveys and uses multiple simulation methods to account for envelope losses and occupant behaviour. When complete, the model may be used to assess the impacts of envelope upgrades or the addition of renewable energy technologies based on high resolution, targeted application.","author":"Swan, L.

Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.","author":"Elman, J","doi":"10.1016/0364-0213(90)90002-E","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/1990/Elman/1990 - Elman - Finding structure in time.pdf:pdf","issn":3640213,"journal":"Cognitive Science","month":"June","number":2,"pages":"179--211","title":"Finding structure in time","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/036402139090002E","volume":14,"year":1990,"authors":[{"personalName":"J","familyName":"Elman"}],"prettyTitle":"Finding Structure in...","prettyAuthors":"J Elman"},"fuzzyLabel":"Finding structure in time J Elman"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Hong2004","entryTags":{"author":"Hong, S and Ridley, Ian and Oreszczyn, Tadj","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2004/Hong, Ridley, Oreszczyn/2004 - Hong, Ridley, Oreszczyn - The impact of energy efficient refurbishment on the airtightness in English dwellings.pdf:pdf","keywords":"air infiltration,central heating,draught stripping,english dwelling,insulation,refurbishment","title":"The impact of energy efficient refurbishment on the airtightness in English dwellings","url":"http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1594/1/UCL-AIVC2004UCLEprints2006Jan.pdf","volume":221,"year":2004,"authors":[{"personalName":"S","familyName":"Hong"},{"personalName":"Ian","familyName":"Ridley"},{"personalName":"Tadj","familyName":"Oreszczyn"}],"prettyTitle":"The Impact of Energy...","prettyAuthors":"S Hong et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"The impact of energy efficient refurbishment on the airtightness in English dwellings S Hong Ian Ridley Tadj Oreszczyn"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Bell2000","entryTags":{"abstract":"This paper sets out the results of the York Energy Demonstration Project and discusses its implications for the modernisation of low rise housing in the UK.

Mostly, it is attributed to inhabitants grading up their heating behaviour to the lower energy cost after retrofit. However, even if inhabitants do not change their heating pattern, the indoor temperature will still rise after retrofit due to physical processes: warmer unheated zones and less temperature drop between two heating periods. This paper uses building energy simulation tools to assess the extent of these physical processes in the overall temperature rise. An existing terraced house is modelled and fictitious renovation measures are imposed, keeping the heating patterns unchanged. For the case analysed, a heating season mean indoor temperature rise of about 1°C is found, being in the same order of magnitude as empirically detected temperature changes. This suggests that the remaining behavioural aspect of the temperature takeback might be smaller than generally assumed. In addition, the comparison is made with a calculation method based on the EPBD regulation that does not take into account the physical temperature rise. The latter method overestimates the potential energy savings by about 6\\%.","author":"Deurinck, Mieke and Saelens, Dirk and Roels, Staf","doi":"10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.05.024","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2012/Deurinck, Saelens, Roels/2012 - Deurinck, Saelens, Roels - Assessment of the physical part of the temperature takeback for residential retrofits.pdf:pdf","journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"Indoor temperature,Residential retrofit,Temperature takeback","pages":"112--121","title":"Assessment of the physical part of the temperature takeback for residential retrofits","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778812002794","volume":52,"year":2012,"authors":[{"personalName":"Mieke","familyName":"Deurinck"},{"personalName":"Dirk","familyName":"Saelens"},{"personalName":"Staf","familyName":"Roels"}],"prettyTitle":"Assessment of the Physical...","prettyAuthors":"Mieke Deurinck et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Assessment of the physical part of the temperature takeback for residential retrofits Mieke Deurinck Dirk Saelens Staf Roels"},{"entryType":"misc","citationKey":"MHL2014","entryTags":{"address":"Fontainebleau","author":"Laurent, Marie H\\'{e}l\\`{e}ne","publisher":"EDF R\\&D","title":"personal communication","year":2014,"authors":[{"personalName":"Marie H\\'{e}l\\`{e}ne","familyName":"Laurent"}],"prettyTitle":"Personal...","prettyAuthors":"Marie H\\'{e}l\\`{e}ne Laurent"},"fuzzyLabel":"personal communication Marie H\\'{e}l\\`{e}ne Laurent"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"DECC2014e","entryTags":{"author":"DECC","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2014/DECC/2014 - DECC - Energy Consumption in the UK.pdf:pdf","number":"July","title":"Energy Consumption in the UK","year":2014,"authors":[{"familyName":"DECC"}],"prettyTitle":"Energy Consumption in the...","prettyAuthors":"DECC"},"fuzzyLabel":"Energy Consumption in the UK undefined DECC"},{"entryType":"phdthesis","citationKey":"Hopes2011","entryTags":{"abstract":"A large-scale continuous campaign management model-based approach that places value on variables that are broad, difficult to measure, and changing with time (from the perspective of behavioral change) does not exist at this time of writing.

A literature review of traditional approaches to campaign management finds that behavioral variables, as well as economic variables, are important in campaign design, and that these types of campaigns need to be up-scaled and applied to a broad audience. A literature review of models is completed within the categories of measurement and verification, behavioral change campaigns, project management, and strategic management to identify an approach to continuous campaign management. Determined to be the best approach for the current research, the balanced scorecard (Kaplan and Norton 1992) is adapted to a campaign perspective. Through seven expert interviews, the proposed approach is applied to seven campaigns in operation. Expert feedback of the proposed approach is recorded and compared with literature theory to gain understanding of gaps between the two. The largest gap is identified in the management of learning and innovation, both in theory and practice. Finally, an updated approach is presented based on expert feedback, and an extension of the current approach is offered by the author for future research.

In recent years, a range of techniques derived from complex systems science has been applied successfully to nonlinear plasma datasets. The present paper reviews several of these techniques in the context of applications spanning fusion, space, solar and astrophysical plasmas. Topics include non-Gaussian probability density functions, notably extreme event distributions in fusion and astrophysics and power law distributions in the solar context; differencing and rescaling of fluctuation data, which has yielded information on the number of dominant plasma turbulent processes, and the spatiotemporal ranges over which they operate, in plasmas ranging from microquasar accretion discs to L-mode and dithering H-mode fusion plasmas in the MAST tokamak; quantitative measures of mutual information content and pattern repetition between causally linked but spatiotemporally separated nonlinear events in solar wind and magnetospheric plasmas; global statistics of full-disc solar irradiance; and ELMing, considered as a sequence of pulsed events, in H-mode fusion plasmas in the JET tokamak. These developments in nonlinear plasma data characterization provide fresh additional insights into the underlying plasma physics.

Both the analysis and the test methodology have evolved since the start of the PASSYS Project in 1985. A programme of upgrading the original PASSYS test cells has improved measurement accuracy. The emphasis has moved from steady state to dynamic methods with shorter test durations yielding improved information and more accurate results. Dynamic test procedures aim to de-couple the different thermal processes within the test cell in order to obtain separation between the thermal transmission and the solar aperture of a component. In parallel with improvements in test methodology, software tools have been developed to enable the identification of the component characteristics and provide statistical information on their accuracies from the dynamic test data. The PASLINK Network has implemented quality procedures and promoted the development of participants’ expertise in the design, preparation and execution of tests and the analysis of test data.","author":"Baker, P.H. and van Dijk, H.A.L.","doi":"10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.10.009","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2008/Baker, van Dijk/2008 - Baker, van Dijk - PASLINK and dynamic outdoor testing of building components.pdf:pdf","issn":3601323,"journal":"Building and Environment","keywords":"Dynamic testing,Parameter identification,Test cells,Thermal and solar properties","month":"February","number":2,"pages":"143--151","title":"PASLINK and dynamic outdoor testing of building components","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132306002940","volume":43,"year":2008,"authors":[{"personalName":"P.H.","familyName":"Baker"},{"personalName":"H.A.L.","familyName":"van Dijk"}],"prettyTitle":"PASLINK and Dynamic Outdoor...","prettyAuthors":"P.H.

The intent is to provide guidance on minimum acceptable levels of performance for determining energy and demand savings, using measurements, in commercial transactions. Note that it is entirely possible to have a sale/ purchase, lease, or other arrangement for energy-efficient equipment that does not involve measurements. Indeed, the vast majority of transactions are of this type. However, if the savings determination is to be based on measurements, certain minimum requirements are necessary in order to avoid a process that appears to be based on actual savings but might be highly inaccurate, biased, or random. It is expected that ASHRAE Guideline 14 will be used for transactions between energy service companies (ESCOs) and their customers and between ESCOs and utilities, where the utilities have elected to purchase energy savings. Use of ASHRAE Guideline 14 is expected to provide savings results sufficiently well specified and reasonably accurate so that the parties to the transaction can have adequate assurance for the payment basis. Other applications of ASHRAE Guideline 14 may include documenting energy savings for various credit programs, e.g., emission reduction credits associated with energy efficiency activities. Determining savings with measurements in accordance with this guideline involves measuring post-retrofit energy use and comparing that to the measured pre-retrofit use, adjusted or normalized, to act as a proxy for the conditions that would have prevailed had the retrofit not been performed. Therefore, determining energy savings through the use of measurements involves more than just verifying that new equipment has been installed and can function as expected, although those tasks are usually a necessary part of determining savings. In addition, energy savings cannot be claimed to be “measured” if no pre-retrofit data are available. Sampling is often used in projects involving end-use monitoring or what we call the “retrofit isolation approach.” Annex B gives procedures to calculate the added uncertainty due to sampling. ASHRAE Guideline 14 may be used to measure the energy savings from a utility sponsored or contracted multiple-building energy conservation project. Applying ASHRAE Guideline 14 to such a project would allow the use of Annex B to calculate the measurement uncertainty directly. The net impacts of large-scale utility energy conservation programs, such as those that may involve market transformation or standard offers for purchase of conservation energy, are specifically excluded from the scope of ASHRAE Guideline 14, although individual and multiple-building projects within such programs are covered. ASHRAE Guideline 14 primarily addresses measurements of energy and demand for determining savings. Other tasks are needed in any energy performance contract. These can include determining appropriate utility rates, inspecting and commissioning equipment, etc. Users of ASHRAE Guideline 14 who are interested in learning more about some of thecontractual issues and types of performance contracts will find relevant discussion in the DOE publication “International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol” (IPMVP 2000) available at <www.ipmvp.org>.","author":"Gillespie, Kenneth L and Cowan, John D and Frazell, Charles Wayne and Haberl, Jeff S and Heinemeier, Kristin H and Kummer, James P and Culp, Charles H and Watson, Thomas E and Arnold, Charles G and Baxter, Van D and Evans, Richard a and Hogan, John F and Kohloss, Frederick H and Montgomery, Ross D","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2002/Gillespie et al/2002 - Gillespie et al. - Measurement of Energy and Demand Savings.pdf:pdf","pages":170,"title":"Measurement of Energy and Demand Savings","volume":8400,"year":2002,"authors":[{"personalName":"Kenneth L","familyName":"Gillespie"},{"personalName":"John D","familyName":"Cowan"},{"personalName":"Charles Wayne","familyName":"Frazell"},{"personalName":"Jeff S","familyName":"Haberl"},{"personalName":"Kristin H","familyName":"Heinemeier"},{"personalName":"James P","familyName":"Kummer"},{"personalName":"Charles H","familyName":"Culp"},{"personalName":"Thomas E","familyName":"Watson"},{"personalName":"Charles G","familyName":"Arnold"},{"personalName":"Van D","familyName":"Baxter"},{"personalName":"Richard a","familyName":"Evans"},{"personalName":"John F","familyName":"Hogan"},{"personalName":"Frederick H","familyName":"Kohloss"},{"personalName":"Ross D","familyName":"Montgomery"}],"prettyTitle":"Measurement of Energy and...","prettyAuthors":"Kenneth L Gillespie et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Measurement of Energy and Demand Savings Kenneth L Gillespie John D Cowan Charles Wayne Frazell Jeff S Haberl Kristin H Heinemeier James P Kummer Charles H Culp Thomas E Watson Charles G Arnold Van D Baxter Richard a Evans John F Hogan Frederick H Kohloss Ross D Montgomery"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Milne2000","entryTags":{"abstract":"The primary aim of this study was to analyse the significance of household temperature in determining the amount of potential energy savings taken back in the form of an increase in the comfort temperature following energy efficiency improvements. If the dual goals of energy conservation and affordable warmth for low-income households are to be attained, the nature of takeback must be more thoroughly understood so that the full benefit of energy efficiency measures can be assessed along with the carbon/energy savings. However, very little analysis has been carried out to quantify the benefit taken as warmth. This research examines the results of a number of monitored energy efficiency projects undertaken in Britain over the past 20 years to try to determine the most important influences on temperature takeback. The main findings are:•the internal temperature is the main determinant on the amount of benefit from energy efficiency measures that will be taken as an increase in comfort rather than as an energy saving;•at 16.5°C, the current average temperature of housing in Great Britain, about 30\\% of the benefit of an energy efficiency improvement would be taken as a temperature increase and the rest as an energy saving;•at temperatures as low as 14°C — still frequently found in low-income households — only half of the energy saving will be achieved and the remainder would be taken as a temperature increase;•20°C is the most likely whole house comfort temperature in an energy efficient house and it is only in these circumstances that further improvements will achieve the full energy saving;•there has been a narrowing of the gap in average indoor winter temperatures of the different tenure types and tenure alone is no longer a definitive indicator of household temperature;•living room temperature is not a good indicator in the UK of whole house average temperature, as a warm living room may be found in an otherwise cold house, particularly in low-income households without central heating;•as there is now little difference between the average temperatures of local authority and owner occupied households, there should be little difference in the overall degree of takeback between these two tenures;•energy efficiency measures which increase radiant temperature, such as double glazing, enable the occupants to be comfortable at a lower air temperature and thus reduce the degree of takeback by up to 20\\%;•there is a lack of suitably monitored and analysed projects to enable a rigorous assessment of takeback, particularly for higher income households;•the present low levels of warmth and slow rate of improvement in average temperatures will mean that investment in the energy efficiency of the UK housing stock will fail to achieve the predicted energy savings for at least another 15 years.","author":"Milne, Geoffrey and Boardman, Brenda","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2000/Milne, Boardman/2000 - Milne, Boardman - Making cold homes warmer the effect of energy efficiency improvements in low-income homes.pdf:pdf","journal":"Energy Policy","number":6,"pages":"411--424","title":"Making cold homes warmer: the effect of energy efficiency improvements in low-income homes","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421500000197","volume":28,"year":2000,"authors":[{"personalName":"Geoffrey","familyName":"Milne"},{"personalName":"Brenda","familyName":"Boardman"}],"prettyTitle":"Making Cold Homes...","prettyAuthors":"Geoffrey Milne et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Making cold homes warmer: the effect of energy efficiency improvements in low-income homes Geoffrey Milne Brenda Boardman"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Schwarz2013","entryTags":{"author":"Schwarz, C.

Such a procedure for model identification is essential for better usage of readings from smart meters, which is expected to be installed in almost all buildings in the coming years. The models can be used for different purposes, e.g. control of the indoor climate, forecasting of energy consumption, and for accurate description of energy performance of the building. Grey-box models based on prior physical knowledge and data-driven modelling are applied. This facilitates insight into otherwise hidden information about the physical properties of the building. A hierarchy of models of increasing complexity is formulated based on prior physical knowledge and a forward selection strategy is suggested enabling the modeller to iteratively select suitable models of increasing complexity. The performance of the models is compared using likelihood ratio tests, and they are validated using a combination of appropriate statistics and physical interpretation of the results. A case study is described in which a suitable model is sought after for a single storey 120m2 building. The result is a set of different models of increasing complexity, with which building characteristics, such as: thermal conductivity, heat capacity of different parts, and window area, are estimated.","author":"Bacher, Peder and Madsen, Henrik","doi":"10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.02.005","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2011/Bacher, Madsen/2011 - Bacher, Madsen - Identifying suitable models for the heat dynamics of buildings.pdf:pdf","issn":3787788,"journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"Buildings,Continuous time modelling,Grey-box models,Heat dynamics,Likelihood ratio tests,Lumped models,Model selection,Parameter estimation,Thermal dynamics","month":"July","number":7,"pages":"1511--1522","title":"Identifying suitable models for the heat dynamics of buildings","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778811000491","volume":43,"year":2011,"authors":[{"personalName":"Peder","familyName":"Bacher"},{"personalName":"Henrik","familyName":"Madsen"}],"prettyTitle":"Identifying Suitable Models...","prettyAuthors":"Peder Bacher et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Identifying suitable models for the heat dynamics of buildings Peder Bacher Henrik Madsen"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Gabe2014","entryTags":{"abstract":"Do tenants pay energy efficiency rent premiums?","author":"Gabe, Jeremy and Rehm, Michael","doi":"10.1108/JPIF-09-2013-0058","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2014/Gabe, Rehm/2014 - Gabe, Rehm - Do tenants pay energy efficiency rent premiums.pdf:pdf","issn":"1463-578X","journal":"Journal of Property Investment \\& Finance","keywords":"Accounting and Finance","language":"en","month":"January","number":4,"pages":"333--351","publisher":"Emerald Group Publishing Limited","title":"Do tenants pay energy efficiency rent premiums?","url":"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1463-578X\\&volume=32\\&issue=4\\&articleid=17115266\\&show=html","volume":32,"year":2014,"authors":[{"personalName":"Jeremy","familyName":"Gabe"},{"personalName":"Michael","familyName":"Rehm"}],"prettyTitle":"Do Tenants Pay Energy...","prettyAuthors":"Jeremy Gabe et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Do tenants pay energy efficiency rent premiums?

On top of the list figures CO2. A major emission source for CO2 is burning fossil fuels. As the residential sector accounts for 28\\% of the country’s annual energy consumption and as this consumption mainly concerns fossil fuels, it has an equally important share in the CO2 release. Hence, at first sight, the best policy for a decrease is by improving the energy efficiency. The question to be solved, however, is which improvement could generate the reduction needed? This study discusses a methodology and comments simulations that help in answering that question. The results are not as simple as one should like. The housing stock in fact acts as a conservatory system. For the case being, the impact of energy efficient new construction on the CO2 release remains quite marginal if the period considered does not extend beyond a decade. The effect becomes significant only over a longer period, on condition that more stringent energy efficiency measures are combined with a shift from new construction to retrofit and reconstruction. Also a diminishing increase in the number of households may help in reducing energy consumption and CO2 release.","author":"Hens, H and Verbeeck, G and Verdonck, B","doi":"10.1016/S0378-7788(00)00092-X","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2001/Hens, Verbeeck, Verdonck/2001 - Hens, Verbeeck, Verdonck - Impact of energy efficiency measures on the CO2 emissions in the residential sector, a large scale ana.pdf:pdf","issn":3787788,"journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"CO2 emissions,Energy consumption,Large scale predictions,Modelling,Residential sector","month":"February","number":3,"pages":"275--281","title":"Impact of energy efficiency measures on the CO2 emissions in the residential sector, a large scale analysis","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877880000092X","volume":33,"year":2001,"authors":[{"personalName":"H","familyName":"Hens"},{"personalName":"G","familyName":"Verbeeck"},{"personalName":"B","familyName":"Verdonck"}],"prettyTitle":"Impact of Energy Efficiency...","prettyAuthors":"H Hens et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Impact of energy efficiency measures on the CO2 emissions in the residential sector, a large scale analysis H Hens G Verbeeck B Verdonck"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Ofgem2013a","entryTags":{"author":"Ofgem","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2013/Ofgem/2013 - Ofgem - The final report of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target ( CERT ) 2008-2012.pdf:pdf","number":"December 2012","pages":"2008--2012","title":"The final report of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target ( CERT ) 2008-2012","year":2013,"authors":[{"familyName":"Ofgem"}],"prettyTitle":"The Final Report of the...","prettyAuthors":"Ofgem"},"fuzzyLabel":"The final report of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target ( CERT ) 2008-2012 undefined Ofgem"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Ali2011","entryTags":{"abstract":"Estimates of daily electrical cooling load for a city of 800,000 are developed based on the relationship between weather variables and daily-average electricity consumption over 1 year.

Heat loss can be estimated using the temperature differences between the inside and outside air and an estimate of the thermal transmittance (U-value) of the wall. Unfortunately the actual U-value may be different from those values obtained using assumptions about the materials, their properties and the structure of the wall after a cursory visual inspection. In-situ monitoring using thermometers and heat flux plates enables more accurate characterisation of the thermal properties of walls in their context. However, standard practices require that the measurements are carried out in winter over a two-week period to significantly reduce the dynamic effects of the wall's thermal mass from the data. A novel combination of a lumped thermal mass model, together with Bayesian statistical analysis is presented to derive estimates of the U-value and effective thermal mass. The method needs only a few days of measurements, provides an estimate of the effective thermal mass and could potentially be used in summer.","author":"Biddulph, Phillip and Gori, Virginia and Elwell, Clifford A. and Scott, Cameron and Rye, Caroline and Lowe, Robert and Oreszczyn, Tadj","doi":"10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.04.004","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2014/Biddulph et al/2014 - Biddulph et al. - Inferring the thermal resistance and effective thermal mass of a wall using frequent temperature and heat flux.pdf:pdf","issn":3787788,"journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"Bayesian Statistics,External wall,Heat Transfer,In-situ Measurements,R-value,Thermal Mass,U-Value","month":"August","pages":"10--16","title":"Inferring the thermal resistance and effective thermal mass of a wall using frequent temperature and heat flux measurements","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778814003041","volume":78,"year":2014,"authors":[{"personalName":"Phillip","familyName":"Biddulph"},{"personalName":"Virginia","familyName":"Gori"},{"personalName":"Clifford A.","familyName":"Elwell"},{"personalName":"Cameron","familyName":"Scott"},{"personalName":"Caroline","familyName":"Rye"},{"personalName":"Robert","familyName":"Lowe"},{"personalName":"Tadj","familyName":"Oreszczyn"}],"prettyTitle":"Inferring the Thermal...","prettyAuthors":"Phillip Biddulph et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Inferring the thermal resistance and effective thermal mass of a wall using frequent temperature and heat flux measurements Phillip Biddulph Virginia Gori Clifford A.

The method is suited to online forecasting in many applications and in this paper it is used to predict hourly values of solar power for horizons of up to 36h. The data used is 15-min observations of solar power from 21 PV systems located on rooftops in a small village in Denmark. The suggested method is a two-stage method where first a statistical normalization of the solar power is obtained using a clear sky model. The clear sky model is found using statistical smoothing techniques. Then forecasts of the normalized solar power are calculated using adaptive linear time series models. Both autoregressive (AR) and AR with exogenous input (ARX) models are evaluated, where the latter takes numerical weather predictions (NWPs) as input. The results indicate that for forecasts up to 2h ahead the most important input is the available observations of solar power, while for longer horizons NWPs are the most important input. A root mean square error improvement of around 35\\% is achieved by the ARX model compared to a proposed reference model.","author":"Bacher, Peder and Madsen, Henrik and Nielsen, Henrik Aalborg","doi":"10.1016/j.solener.2009.05.016","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2009/Bacher, Madsen, Nielsen/2009 - Bacher, Madsen, Nielsen - Online short-term solar power forecasting.pdf:pdf","issn":"0038092X","journal":"Solar Energy","keywords":"Clear sky model,Forecasting,Numerical weather predictions,Photovoltaic,Prediction,Quantile regression,Recursive least squares,Solar power,Time series","month":"October","number":10,"pages":"1772--1783","title":"Online short-term solar power forecasting","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X09001364","volume":83,"year":2009,"authors":[{"personalName":"Peder","familyName":"Bacher"},{"personalName":"Henrik","familyName":"Madsen"},{"personalName":"Henrik Aalborg","familyName":"Nielsen"}],"prettyTitle":"Online Short-Term Solar Power...","prettyAuthors":"Peder Bacher et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Online short-term solar power forecasting Peder Bacher Henrik Madsen Henrik Aalborg Nielsen"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Laurent2009a","entryTags":{"author":"Laurent, MH and Osso, Dominique","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2009/Laurent, Osso/2009 - Laurent, Osso - Energy savings and costs of energy efficiency measures a gap from policy to reality.pdf:pdf","keywords":"energy savings,financial,residential building,retrofitting cost","pages":"571--582","title":"Energy savings and costs of energy efficiency measures: a gap from policy to reality?","url":"https://www.etde.org/etdeweb/details\\_open.jsp?osti\\_id=967645","year":2009,"authors":[{"personalName":"MH","familyName":"Laurent"},{"personalName":"Dominique","familyName":"Osso"}],"prettyTitle":"Energy Savings and Costs of...","prettyAuthors":"MH Laurent et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Energy savings and costs of energy efficiency measures: a gap from policy to reality?

A novel feature of DECM is the adoption of an occupancy pattern model which is derived from the household employment status data. We believe this modification has significantly improved the accuracy of the estimation in space heating energy use. At national level, the model estimation of carbon emissions and gas and electricity consumptions are respectively 4.5\\%, 3.4\\% and 1.0\\% higher than the national statistics. At the sub-national level (Local Authority), two methods are used to produce estimations: one based on dwelling type and the other based on socio-economic class. For both methods, the correlations between the model estimations and the government records are statistically significant and substantial (all rs > 0.9 and ps<0.01). According to the results, it can be inferred that over 85\\% of the variance in dwelling energy consumptions and carbon emissions can be accounted for by dwelling type and the socio-economic class of households. The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis which examines the effects of various building fabric and service system parameters on the modelled average carbon emissions per dwelling. Based on the findings, a set of predictive charts are developed which can provide rapid estimations of the effect of various energy efficiency measures on dwelling energy consumptions and carbon emissions taking into account the potential rebound effect. In summary, this paper shows that the DECM model can be a useful tool to assist the formation of energy efficiency policies at both national and local levels.","author":"Cheng, Vicky and Steemers, Koen","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2011/Cheng, Steemers/2011 - Cheng, Steemers - Modelling domestic energy consumption at district scale A tool to support national and local energy policies.pdf:pdf","journal":"Environmental Modelling \\& Software","keywords":"Domestic energy model,Dwelling carbon emission,Housing stock model,Local energy policy","number":10,"pages":"1186--1198","title":"Modelling domestic energy consumption at district scale: A tool to support national and local energy policies","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815211001034","volume":26,"year":2011,"authors":[{"personalName":"Vicky","familyName":"Cheng"},{"personalName":"Koen","familyName":"Steemers"}],"prettyTitle":"Modelling Domestic Energy...","prettyAuthors":"Vicky Cheng et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Modelling domestic energy consumption at district scale: A tool to support national and local energy policies Vicky Cheng Koen Steemers"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Yalcintas2008","entryTags":{"abstract":"Energy-consumption data collected from two equipment-retrofit projects before and after the retrofits was used to develop a model that estimates energy savings from retrofit projects. The computation method used in the model is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model integrates weather variables, specific equipment-usage and occupancy data, and building-operation schedules into the pre-retrofit energy-usage pattern. It then estimates the energy usage of the pre-retrofit equipment in the post-retrofit period by using weather data, occupancy, and building-operation schedules in the post-retrofit period. The difference between the recorded energy usage of the post-retrofit equipment and the predicted energy usage of the pre-retrofit equipment in the post-retrofit period is the estimate of energy savings. For the two retrofit projects used in the ANN model, the coefficient of correlation varied from 0.957 to 0.844; the root mean square error varied from 6.81\\% to 16.4\\%; and the mean absolute error varied from 5.31\\% to 9.95\\%. Additionally, the sensitivity of the model to the input variables was analyzed with one of the retrofit project data.

We find that the reduction is robust to different specifications, selection-bias correction methods and subsamples of the original data.

However, early attempts to encourage energy conservation demonstrated that these frameworks often miss important contextual factors such as cultural values and behavioural interactions with technologies. This evidence, combined with the present need for energy policies that can address environmental, social, and economic concerns, suggests that a broader perspective is needed. Integrated frameworks of DEC were first proposed over 20 years ago but very little has been said about the ideas proposed in these papers, whether it be critiquing their form or assessing their impact on theory and practice. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the influence of integrated frameworks in academic literature and in UK energy policy. It is argued that a common language could stimulate renewed interest in the integrated perspective and thereby help policy makers meet these diverse goals. To this end, a flexible agent-based framework is proposed to stimulate debate and clarify the role of an integrated approach to domestic energy policy.","author":"Keirstead, James","doi":"10.1016/j.enpol.2005.06.004","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2006/Keirstead/2006 - Keirstead - Evaluating the applicability of integrated domestic energy consumption frameworks in the UK.pdf:pdf","issn":3014215,"journal":"Energy Policy","keywords":"Agent-based,Domestic energy consumption,Integrated framework","month":"November","number":17,"pages":"3065--3077","title":"Evaluating the applicability of integrated domestic energy consumption frameworks in the UK","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421505001606","volume":34,"year":2006,"authors":[{"personalName":"James","familyName":"Keirstead"}],"prettyTitle":"Evaluating the Applicability...","prettyAuthors":"James Keirstead"},"fuzzyLabel":"Evaluating the applicability of integrated domestic energy consumption frameworks in the UK James Keirstead"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Hu2010","entryTags":{"abstract":"Applying sparse algorithm can improve the prediction speed of support vector regression effectively.

The character of their frequency distributions at 237, 327, 408 and 610 MHz in both L- and R-handed circular polarizations is studied. While for the complete time intervals no simple distributions of spikes (either exponential or power-law) are recognized, for shorter intervals both exponential and power-law distributions are observed. No significant difference is found in the distributions for L- and R-polarized data. Further analysis reveals that spikes appearing in dense groups and with high intensities preferentially have exponential distributions, while the sparse spikes with lower intensities are rather characterized by power-law distribution functions with high exponents. Groups of independent spikes (cases with low rates and low intensities) have power-law distributions trend in agreement with the coherent spike mechanisms. Tests are provided regarding statistical analyses. The nonlinear analysis reveals that the degree of complexity of the system varies. It decreases when the attractor dimensions and the Lyapunov exponents assume smaller values, which happens when very strong spikes are present. The changing characteristics of the statistical parameters are probably the result of a mutual interaction in the source environment or a product of propagation conditions.","author":"M\\'{e}sz\\'{a}rosov\\'{a}, H and Karlick\\'{y}, M and Veronig, a and Zlobec, P and M.Messerotti","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2000/M\\'{e}sz\\'{a}rosov\\'{a} et al/2000 - M\\'{e}sz\\'{a}rosov\\'{a} et al. - Linear and nonlinear statistical analysis of narrow-band dm-spikes observed during the June 15, 1991 flar.pdf:pdf","issn":46361,"journal":"Astronomy \\& Astrophysics","keywords":"Sun: flares,Sun: magnetic fields,Sun: radio radiation,acceleration of particles,methods: data analysis,methods: statistical","pages":"1126--1138","title":"Linear and nonlinear statistical analysis of narrow-band dm-spikes observed during the June 15, 1991 flare","volume":360,"year":2000,"authors":[{"personalName":"H","familyName":"M\\'{e}sz\\'{a}rosov\\'{a}"},{"personalName":"M","familyName":"Karlick\\'{y}"},{"personalName":"a","familyName":"Veronig"},{"personalName":"P","familyName":"Zlobec"},{"familyName":"M.Messerotti"}],"prettyTitle":"Linear and Nonlinear...","prettyAuthors":"H M\\'{e}sz\\'{a}rosov\\'{a et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Linear and nonlinear statistical analysis of narrow-band dm-spikes observed during the June 15, 1991 flare H M\\'{e}sz\\'{a}rosov\\'{a} M Karlick\\'{y} a Veronig P Zlobec undefined M.Messerotti"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Tso2007","entryTags":{"abstract":"This study presents three modeling techniques for the prediction of electricity energy consumption.

In 2005–2006, this high group consumed more energy than the other two groups combined and accounted for most increases in energy use; their gas usage rose by 20\\% to 130kWh/day (110–150), electricity by 75\\% to 28kWh/day (CI: 25.3–31.2), and had 50\\% higher energy intensity at 172Wh/m2 (CI: 150–195). On average the high group comprised dwellings that were larger, had been extended, and whose occupants had higher incomes than the two other groups. The results suggest that research for the development of energy policy, including building regulations, should focus both on how energy is currently used and on households where the largest future increases are likely to occur.","author":"Summerfield, Alex J. and Lowe, R.J. and Bruhns, H.R. and Caeiro, J.A. and Steadman, J.P. and Oreszczyn, T.","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2007/Summerfield et al/2007 - Summerfield et al. - Milton Keynes Energy Park revisited Changes in internal temperatures and energy usage.pdf:pdf","journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"Domestic sector,Energy use,Internal temperatures,Longitudinal study,Residential sector,dataValues,longTerm,readFall13","mendeley-tags":"dataValues,longTerm,readFall13","number":7,"pages":"783--791","title":"Milton Keynes Energy Park revisited: Changes in internal temperatures and energy usage","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778807000576","volume":39,"year":2007,"authors":[{"personalName":"Alex J.","familyName":"Summerfield"},{"personalName":"R.J.","familyName":"Lowe"},{"personalName":"H.R.","familyName":"Bruhns"},{"personalName":"J.A.","familyName":"Caeiro"},{"personalName":"J.P.","familyName":"Steadman"},{"personalName":"T.","familyName":"Oreszczyn"}],"prettyTitle":"Milton Keynes Energy Park...","prettyAuthors":"Alex J.

The past decades have seen significant improvements in building energy efficiency through the introduction of new building regulations and the construction of low energy buildings. However, the expected energy reduction has not been observed, largely due to the complicated and hard-to-predict nature of occupant behavior. This paper explores the impact of occupants on residential energy consumption in China. Surveys related to behavior and energy use in the city of Hangzhou were collected in the winter (n=642) and summer (n=838). Findings show that occupant age is a more significant factor than income. Contrary to existing research, a negative correlation between occupant age and energy consumption was found in this study. Elderly residents exhibit a more frugal behavior pattern than the younger ones. In addition, this paper reveals that household socio-economic and behavior variables are able to explain 28.8\\% of the variation in heating and cooling energy consumption.","author":"Chen, Jun and Wang, Xiaohong and Steemers, Koen","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2013/Chen, Wang, Steemers/2013 -

Methods exist for predicting baseline energy use, but a limitation of most statistical methods reported in the literature is inadequate quantification of the uncertainty in baseline energy use predictions. However, estimation of uncertainty is essential for weighing the risks of investing in retrofits. Most commercial buildings have, or soon will have, electricity meters capable of providing data at short time intervals. These data provide new opportunities to quantify uncertainty in baseline predictions, and to do so after shorter measurement durations than are traditionally used. In this paper, we show that uncertainty estimation provides greater measurement and verification (M\\&V) information and helps to overcome some of the difficulties with deciding how much data is needed to develop baseline models and to confirm energy savings. We also show that cross-validation is an effective method for computing uncertainty. In so doing, we extend a simple regression-based method of predicting energy use using short-interval meter data. We demonstrate the methods by predicting energy use in 17 real commercial buildings. We discuss the benefits of uncertainty estimates which can provide actionable decision making information for investing in energy conservation measures.","author":"Walter, Travis and Price, Phillip N. and Sohn, Michael D.","doi":"10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.05.030","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2014/Walter, Price, Sohn/2014 - Walter, Price, Sohn - Uncertainty estimation improves energy measurement and verification procedures.pdf:pdf","issn":3062619,"journal":"Applied Energy","keywords":"Baseline prediction,Building energy,Change-point model,Cross-validation,ECM,ESCO,HVAC,IPMVP,International Performance Measurement and Verifica,M\\&V,Measurement and verification,Uncertainty analysis,energy conservation measure,energy service company,heating, ventilation, and air conditioning,measurement and verification","month":"October","pages":"230--236","title":"Uncertainty estimation improves energy measurement and verification procedures","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030626191400525X","volume":130,"year":2014,"authors":[{"personalName":"Travis","familyName":"Walter"},{"personalName":"Phillip N.","familyName":"Price"},{"personalName":"Michael D.","familyName":"Sohn"}],"prettyTitle":"Uncertainty Estimation...","prettyAuthors":"Travis Walter et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Uncertainty estimation improves energy measurement and verification procedures Travis Walter Phillip N.

However, in order to calculate the air change rate accurately several aspects have to be considered. One important parameter is the ventilation system. Whether the building has a mechanical exhaust-only, supply-only, balanced exhaust–supply or natural ventilation system will influence the air infiltration rate through cracks in the building envelope. High infiltration rates lead to an increase in the heating demand and can result in an inadequate capacity of the designed heating installation. In this paper, computer simulations of the air change rate for a detached single-family house are presented. The house is simulated in different topographical surroundings, equipped with a mechanical exhaust-only, or a balanced exhaust–supply, ventilation system. In addition, the airtightness of the building is varied, from very tight, 1 air change per hour (ACH), to quite leaky, 6 ACH, when pressurized to 50Pa. Results from the simulations show that the same house has quite different air change rates in different surroundings with different airtightness.","author":"Mattsson, Bj\\\"{o}rn,\ndoi = {10.1016/j.energy.2005.04.008},\nfile = {:Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2006/Mattsson/2006 - Mattsson - The influence of wind speed, terrain and ventilation system on the air change rate of a single-family house.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {03605442},\njournal = {Energy},\nmonth = apr,\nnumber = {5},\npages = {719--731},\ntitle = {{The influence of wind speed, terrain and ventilation system on the air change rate of a single-family house}},\nurl = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544205000824},\nvolume = {31},\nyear = {2006}","authors":[{"personalName":"Bj\\\"{o}rn,\ndoi = {10.1016/j.energy.2005.04.008},\nfile = {:Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2006/Mattsson/2006 - Mattsson - The influence of wind speed","familyName":"Mattsson"},{"personalName":"terrain","familyName":"ventilation system on the air change rate of a single-family house.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {03605442},\njournal = {Energy},\nmonth = apr,\nnumber = {5},\npages = {719--731},\ntitle = {{The influence of wind speed"},{"familyName":"ventilation system on the air change rate of a single-family house}},\nurl = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544205000824},\nvolume = {31},\nyear = {2006}"}]}},{"entryType":"misc","citationKey":"Eura","entryTags":{"author":"EU","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2010/EU/2010 - EU - Directive 201031EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings - Lex.pdf:pdf","title":"Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings - LexUriServ.do","url":"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:153:0013:0035:EN:PDF","year":2010,"authors":[{"familyName":"EU"}],"prettyTitle":"Directive 2010/31/EU of the...","prettyAuthors":"EU"},"fuzzyLabel":"Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings - LexUriServ.do undefined EU"},{"entryType":"inproceedings","citationKey":"Chen2013a","entryTags":{"address":"New York, New York, USA","author":"Chen, Dong and Barker, Sean and Subbaswamy, Adarsh and Irwin, David and Shenoy, Prashant","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 5th ACM Workshop on Embedded Systems For Energy-Efficient Buildings - BuildSys'13","doi":"10.1145/2528282.2528294","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2013/Chen et al/2013 - Chen et al. - Non-Intrusive Occupancy Monitoring using Smart Meters.pdf:pdf","isbn":9781450324311,"keywords":"Electricity,Energy,Grid","month":"November","pages":"1--8","publisher":"ACM Press","title":"Non-Intrusive Occupancy Monitoring using Smart Meters","url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2528282.2528294","year":2013,"authors":[{"personalName":"Dong","familyName":"Chen"},{"personalName":"Sean","familyName":"Barker"},{"personalName":"Adarsh","familyName":"Subbaswamy"},{"personalName":"David","familyName":"Irwin"},{"personalName":"Prashant","familyName":"Shenoy"}],"prettyTitle":"Non-Intrusive Occupancy...","prettyAuthors":"Dong Chen et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Non-Intrusive Occupancy Monitoring using Smart Meters Dong Chen Sean Barker Adarsh Subbaswamy David Irwin Prashant Shenoy"},{"entryType":"misc","citationKey":"EVO","entryTags":{"author":"EVO","title":"Efficiency Valuation Organization","url":"http://www.evo-world.org/index.php?lang=en","urldate":"2014-11-17","authors":[{"familyName":"EVO"}],"prettyTitle":"Efficiency Valuation...","prettyAuthors":"EVO"},"fuzzyLabel":"Efficiency Valuation Organization undefined EVO"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Gowri2009","entryTags":{"abstract":"This report presents a methodology for modeling air infiltration in EnergyPlus to account for envelope air barrier characteristics.

The findings show that the ESIs constituted a very minor element within the broader evidence-base used by policymakers, and that this indicator set and its objectives were poorly known even to central players in the sector. The findings of this research provide further evidence for the observation that scientific knowledge (including evaluations, assessments and indicators) seldom play an instrumental role in policymaking, and are more likely to produce indirect, conceptual and political impacts. The analysis provides a number of tentative conclusions concerning such potential indirect impacts that accrue mainly through processes of dialogue and argumentation both during the preparation of the indicators and after their publication as part of the annual reporting by the UK energy department. The ESIs have played various conceptual and political roles, yet the concrete outcomes in terms of policy change remain to be explored. The conclusions highlight the limitations of rationalist notions of direct, instrumental use in the efforts to understand the role of indicators in policymaking. The paper concludes by three tentative propositions concerning the explanations to the absence of instrumental role of the ESIs, which could be usefully explored in future research: the characteristics of the energy sector; the characteristics of the UK policy culture; and the exceptionality of the ESIs in the general evidence-base of UK energy sector.","author":"Lehtonen, Markku","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.10.026","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2013/Lehtonen/2013 - Lehtonen - The non-use and influence of UK Energy Sector Indicators.pdf:pdf","issn":"1470160X","journal":"Ecological Indicators","keywords":"Energy indicators,Energy sector,Knowledge use,Models of policymaking","month":"December","pages":"24--34","title":"The non-use and influence of UK Energy Sector Indicators","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X12003779","volume":35,"year":2013,"authors":[{"personalName":"Markku","familyName":"Lehtonen"}],"prettyTitle":"The Non-Use and Influence of...","prettyAuthors":"Markku Lehtonen"},"fuzzyLabel":"The non-use and influence of UK Energy Sector Indicators Markku Lehtonen"},{"entryType":"techreport","citationKey":"NAVIGANT2012a","entryTags":{"author":"NAVIGANT","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2012/NAVIGANT/2012 - NAVIGANT - Massachusetts three year cross-cutting behavioural program evaluation integrated report.pdf:pdf","institution":"MASSACHUSETTS ENERGY EFFICIENCY ADVISORY COUNCIL \\& BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH","keywords":"behave","mendeley-tags":"behave","number":"July","title":"Massachusetts three year cross-cutting behavioural program evaluation integrated report","volume":2451,"year":2012,"authors":[{"familyName":"NAVIGANT"}],"prettyTitle":"Massachusetts Three Year...","prettyAuthors":"NAVIGANT"},"fuzzyLabel":"Massachusetts three year cross-cutting behavioural program evaluation integrated report undefined NAVIGANT"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Breitung1995","entryTags":{"author":"Breitung, Jorg and Hamilton, James D.","doi":"10.2307/2076916","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/1995/Breitung, Hamilton/1995 - Breitung, Hamilton - Time Series Analysis.pdf:pdf","issn":943061,"journal":"Contemporary Sociology","month":"March","number":2,"pages":271,"title":"Time Series Analysis.","url":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2076916?origin=crossref","volume":24,"year":1995,"authors":[{"personalName":"Jorg","familyName":"Breitung"},{"personalName":"James D.","familyName":"Hamilton"}],"prettyTitle":"Time Series...","prettyAuthors":"Jorg Breitung et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Time Series Analysis.

The methodology is based upon estimates of the expenditure elasticity and GHG intensity of 16 categories of goods and services, and allows for the capital cost and embodied emissions of the energy efficiency measures themselves. The study finds that rebound effects, in GHG terms, are modest (0-32\\%) for measures affecting domestic energy use, larger (25-65\\%) for measures affecting vehicle fuel use and very large (66-106\\%) for measures that reduce food waste. Furthermore, measures undertaken by low income households are associated with the largest rebound effects, with direct emissions forming a larger proportion of the total rebound effect for those households. Measures that are subsidised or affect highly taxed energy commodities may be less effective in reducing aggregate emissions. These findings highlight the importance of allowing for rebound effects within policy appraisals, as well as reinforcing the case for economy-wide carbon pricing. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","author":"Chitnis, Mona and Sorrell, Steve and Druckman, Angela and Firth, Steven K. and Jackson, Tim","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.07.003","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2014/Chitnis et al/2014 - Chitnis et al. - Who rebounds most Estimating direct and indirect rebound effects for different UK socioeconomic groups.pdf:pdf","isbn":"0301-4215","issn":9218009,"journal":"Ecological Economics","keywords":"Household expenditure,Income effects,Re-spending,Rebound effect","pages":"12--32","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"Who rebounds most?

The case study dwellings were occupied by elderly householders or families with young children and were either awaiting or had received a combination of draught proofing, insulation and central heating measures under England’s Warm Front Scheme. The findings show that the Warm Front Scheme resulted in a mean increase of 1.6 °C in indoor temperature and a mean increase of 12 \\% in fuel consumption. Nevertheless, the switch from electricity to gas for space heating following the introduction of gas boilers resulted in a mean reduction in heating cost by 7 \\%. The scheme was found to have negligible impact on carbon emissions. Characteristic differences were observed with individual energy efficiency measures. Central heating resulted in the greatest temperature rise by 2.3 °C followed by insulation by 0.7 °C with a negligible impact from draught proofing. Clear evidence was found in householders increasing the demand temperature following the introduction of a central heating system while no evidence of this was found following the introduction of insulation. In terms of energy use, insulation resulted in a mean saving of 9 \\% but fell short by 74 \\% to 84 \\% from the theoretical prediction while central heating resulted in a mean increase of 29 \\% in the energy consumption. Draught proofing was found to have little impact on the energy use. When examined in terms of energy cost, insulation and central heating all resulted in mean cost savings of 13 \\% and 9 \\% respectively but falling short by 55 \\% to 72 \\% and 57 \\% to 82 \\% compared to their respective theoretically predicted mean cost savings. Insulation also resulted in mean carbon emissions saving of 13 \\% but fell short by 56 \\% to 73 \\% from the theoretical prediction while central heating resulted in insignificant carbon emissions saving. Combining insulation with central heating was found to be beneficial in terms of mitigating the energy consumption rise associated with central heating from 29 \\% down to 16 \\% while maximizing the temperature gain by as much as 3.1 °C.","author":"Hong, Sung-hyon","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2011/Hong/2011 - Hong - CHANGES IN SPACE HEATING ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOLLOWING ENERGY EFFICIENT REFURBISHMENT IN LOW-INCOME DWELLINGS IN ENGLAND.pdf:pdf","number":"September","title":"CHANGES IN SPACE HEATING ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOLLOWING ENERGY EFFICIENT REFURBISHMENT IN LOW-INCOME DWELLINGS IN ENGLAND","year":2011,"authors":[{"personalName":"Sung-hyon","familyName":"Hong"}],"prettyTitle":"CHANGES in SPACE HEATING...","prettyAuthors":"Sung-hyon Hong"},"fuzzyLabel":"CHANGES IN SPACE HEATING ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOLLOWING ENERGY EFFICIENT REFURBISHMENT IN LOW-INCOME DWELLINGS IN ENGLAND Sung-hyon Hong"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Hughes2014","entryTags":{"abstract":"Housing energy models support informed decision-making for energy efficiency and CO2 reduction strategies.

Principal component analysis (PCA) has the potential to overcome such drawbacks. While a few case studies have already attempted to apply this technique to building energy data, the objectives of this study were to make a broader evaluation of PCA and multiple regression analysis (MRA) and to establish guidelines under which one approach is preferable to the other. Four geographic locations in the US with different climatic conditions were selected and synthetic data sequences representative of daily energy use in large institutional buildings were generated in each location using a linear model with outdoor temperature, outdoor specific humidity and solar radiation as the three regression variables. MRA and PCA approaches were then applied to these data sets and their relative performances were compared. Conditions under which PCA seems to perform better than MRA were identified and preliminary recommendations on the use of either modeling approach formulated.","author":"Reddy, T.A. and Claridge, D.E.","doi":"10.1016/0378-7788(94)90014-0","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/1994/Reddy, Claridge/1994 - Reddy, Claridge - Using synthetic data to evaluate multiple regression and principal component analyses for statistical modeling.pdf:pdf","issn":3787788,"journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"PCA","mendeley-tags":"PCA","month":"January","number":1,"pages":"35--44","title":"Using synthetic data to evaluate multiple regression and principal component analyses for statistical modeling of daily building energy consumption","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378778894900140","volume":21,"year":1994,"authors":[{"personalName":"T.A.","familyName":"Reddy"},{"personalName":"D.E.","familyName":"Claridge"}],"prettyTitle":"Using Synthetic Data to...","prettyAuthors":"T.A.

Many countries have made pledges under the Copenhagen Accord to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Commitments have also been made by the G-20 and APEC to phase out inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies. Are we, at last, on the path to a secure, reliable and environmentally sustainable energy system? Updated projections of energy demand, production, trade and investment, fuel by fuel and region by region to 2035 are provided in the 2010 edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO). It includes, for the first time, a new scenario that anticipates future actions by governments to meet the commitments they have made to tackle climate change and growing energy insecurity. WEO-2010 shows: · what more must be done and spent to achieve the goal of the Copenhagen Accord to limit the global temperature increase to 2°C and how these actions would impact on oil markets; · how emerging economies – led by China and India – will increasingly shape the global energy landscape; · what role renewables can play in a clean and secure energy future; · what removing fossil-fuel subsidies would mean for energy markets, climate change and state budgets; · the trends in Caspian energy markets and the implications for global energy supply; · the prospects for unconventional oil; and · how to give the entire global population access to modern energy services. With extensive data, projections and analysis, WEO-2010 provides invaluable insights into how the energy system could evolve over the next quarter of a century.

The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples, and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors. A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with mathematical theory. In the twenty years since the first edition of this book appeared, the ideas and techniques of nonlinear dynamics and chaos have found application to such exciting new fields as systems biology, evolutionary game theory, and sociophysics.

We compare a sharp-transition model with three models incorporating smooth transitions: the hyperbolic-tangent, bent-hyperbola, and bent-cable models.

Building performance evaluation and certification (BPEC) tools are vital for estimating and recommending cost effective improvements to building energy efficiency and lowering overall emissions. In the UK, building performance is estimated using the standard assessment procedure (SAP) for new dwellings and Reduced SAP (RdSAP) for existing dwellings. Using a systems based approach we show there are many opportunities for improving the effectiveness of BPEC tools. In particular, if the building stock is going to meet future energy and climate change targets the system driving building energy efficiency will need to become more efficient. In order to achieve this goal, building performance standards across Europe are compared highlighting the most effective strategies where they are found. It is shown that the large variance between estimated and actual energy performance from dwellings in the UK may be preventing the adoption of bottom-up energy efficiency measures. We show that despite popular belief, SAP and RdSAP do not estimate building energy efficiency but instead attempt to estimate the cost-effective performance of a building and thus create perverse incentives that may lead to additional CO2 emissions. In this regard, the SAP standard confounds cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and environmental performance giving an inadequate estimate of all three policy objectives. Important contributions for improving measurement, analysis, synthesis and certification of building performance characteristics are offered.","author":"Kelly, Scott and Crawford-Brown, Doug and Pollitt, Michael G.","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2012/Kelly, Crawford-Brown, Pollitt/2012 - Kelly, Crawford-Brown, Pollitt - Building performance evaluation and certification in the UK Is SAP fit for purpose.pdf:pdf","journal":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","keywords":"Building stock,Buildings,Dwellings,Energy performance certificates,Microgeneration,SAP,critical,important,readFall13","mendeley-tags":"SAP,critical,important,readFall13","number":9,"pages":"6861--6878","title":"Building performance evaluation and certification in the UK: Is SAP fit for purpose?","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032112004595","volume":16,"year":2012,"authors":[{"personalName":"Scott","familyName":"Kelly"},{"personalName":"Doug","familyName":"Crawford-Brown"},{"personalName":"Michael G.","familyName":"Pollitt"}],"prettyTitle":"Building Performance...","prettyAuthors":"Scott Kelly et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Building performance evaluation and certification in the UK: Is SAP fit for purpose?

For issuing DR events it is key to understand the inter-temporal consumption dynamics as to appropriately segment the user population. We propose to infer occupancy states from consumption time series data using a hidden Markov model framework. Occupancy is characterized in this model by 1) magnitude, 2) duration, and 3) variability. We show that users may be grouped according to their consumption patterns into groups that exhibit qualitatively different dynamics that may be exploited for program enrollment purposes. We investigate empirically the information that residential energy consumers' temporal energy demand patterns characterized by these three dimensions may convey about their demographic, household, and appliance stock characteristics. Our analysis shows that temporal patterns in the user's consumption data can predict with good accuracy certain user characteristics. We use this framework to argue that there is a large degree of individual predictability in user consumption at a population level.","author":"Albert, Adrian and Rajagopal, Ram","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2266122","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2013/Albert, Rajagopal/2013 - Albert, Rajagopal - Smart Meter Driven Segmentation What Your Consumption Says About You.pdf:pdf","issn":"0885-8950","journal":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","month":"November","number":4,"pages":"4019--4030","shorttitle":"Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on","title":"Smart Meter Driven Segmentation: What Your Consumption Says About You","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6545387","volume":28,"year":2013,"authors":[{"personalName":"Adrian","familyName":"Albert"},{"personalName":"Ram","familyName":"Rajagopal"}],"prettyTitle":"Smart Meter Driven...","prettyAuthors":"Adrian Albert et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Smart Meter Driven Segmentation: What Your Consumption Says About You Adrian Albert Ram Rajagopal"},{"entryType":"techreport","citationKey":"EDF2014","entryTags":{"address":"Commercy, France","author":"EDF","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2014/EDF/2014 - EDF - Visit report Savecom - contracting in energy efficiency refurbishment Visit report Savecom - contracting in energy effici.pdf:pdf","number":2366852,"pages":"1--7","title":"Visit report : Savecom - contracting in energy efficiency refurbishment Visit report : Savecom - contracting in energy efficiency refurbishment","year":2014,"authors":[{"familyName":"EDF"}],"prettyTitle":"Visit Report...","prettyAuthors":"EDF"},"fuzzyLabel":"Visit report : Savecom - contracting in energy efficiency refurbishment Visit report : Savecom - contracting in energy efficiency refurbishment undefined EDF"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Vine1994","entryTags":{"author":"Vine, EL","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/1994/Vine/1994 - Vine - The Human Dimension of Program Evaluation.pdf:pdf","journal":"Energy","keywords":"behave","mendeley-tags":"behave","number":2,"pages":"165--178","title":"The Human Dimension of Program Evaluation","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0360544294900574","volume":19,"year":1994,"authors":[{"personalName":"EL","familyName":"Vine"}],"prettyTitle":"The Human Dimension of...","prettyAuthors":"EL Vine"},"fuzzyLabel":"The Human Dimension of Program Evaluation EL Vine"},{"entryType":"misc","citationKey":"Oreszczyn2014","entryTags":{"address":"London","author":"Oreszczyn, Tadj","publisher":"UCL Energy Institute","title":"personal communication","year":2014,"authors":[{"personalName":"Tadj","familyName":"Oreszczyn"}],"prettyTitle":"Personal...","prettyAuthors":"Tadj Oreszczyn"},"fuzzyLabel":"personal communication Tadj Oreszczyn"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Hsiao2015a","entryTags":{"abstract":"The very short-term load forecasting (VSTLF) problem is of particular interest for use in smart grid and automated demand response applications.

Several daily behavior pattern types were obtained by analyzing the time series of daily electricity consumption, and context features from various sources were collected and used to establish a rule set for use in anticipating the likely behavior pattern type of a specific day. Meanwhile, an electricity consumption volume prediction model was developed for each behavior pattern type to predict the load at a specific time point in a day.

Benchmarking models are mostly constructed in a simple benchmark table (percentile table) of energy use, which is normalized with floor area and temperature. This paper describes a benchmarking process for energy efficiency by means of multiple regression analysis, where the relationship between energy-use intensities (EUIs) and the explanatory factors (e.g., operating hours) is developed. Using the resulting regression model, these EUIs are then normalized by removing the effect of deviance in the significant explanatory factors. The empirical cumulative distribution of the normalized EUI gives a benchmark table (or percentile table of EUI) for benchmarking an observed EUI. The advantage of this approach is that the benchmark table represents a normalized distribution of EUI, taking into account all the significant explanatory factors that affect energy consumption. An application to supermarkets is presented to illustrate the development and the use of the benchmarking method.","author":"Chung, William and Hui, Y.V. and Lam, Y.

This paper introduces a hybrid framework developed to assess future household energy demand in France. Res-IRF, a bottom–up module of energy consumption for space heating, has several distinctive features: (i) a clear separation between energy efficiency, i.e. investment in energy efficient technologies, and sufficiency, i.e. changes in the utilization of energy consuming durables which allows the rebound effect to be assessed; (ii) the inclusion of barriers to energy efficiency in the form of intangible costs, consumer heterogeneity parameters and the learning-by-doing process; (iii) an endogenous determination of retrofitting which represents trade-offs between retrofit quantity and quality. Subsequently, Res-IRF is linked to the IMACLIM-R computable general equilibrium model. This exercise shows that, compared to a 37\\% reduction in final energy demand achievable in business as usual in existing dwellings in 2050, an additional reduction of 21\\% could be achieved if relevant barriers to efficiency and sufficiency were overcome.","annote":"Mostly economic approach","author":"Giraudet, Louis-Ga\\\"{e}tan and Guivarch, C\\'{e}line and Quirion, Philippe,\nfile = {:Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2012/Giraudet, Guivarch, Quirion/2012 - Giraudet, Guivarch, Quirion - Exploring the potential for energy conservation in French households through hybrid modeling.pdf:pdf},\njournal = {Energy Economics},\nkeywords = {Barriers to energy efficiency,C63,D10,D80,Endogenous retrofitting dynamics,Hybrid modeling,Intangible costs,Q47,Rebound effect,Residential heating},\nnumber = {2},\npages = {426--445},\ntitle = {{Exploring the potential for energy conservation in French households through hybrid modeling}},\nurl = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014098831100140X},\nvolume = {34},\nyear = {2012}","authors":[{"personalName":"Louis-Ga\\\"{e}tan","familyName":"Giraudet"},{"personalName":"C\\'{e}line","familyName":"Guivarch"},{"personalName":"Philippe,\nfile = {:Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2012/Giraudet","familyName":"Quirion"}]}},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Goldberg1986","entryTags":{"author":"Goldberg, ML and Fels, MF","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/1986/Goldberg, Fels/1986 - Goldberg, Fels - Refraction of PRISM Results into Components of Saved Energy.pdf:pdf","journal":"Energy and Buildings","pages":"169--180","title":"Refraction of PRISM Results into Components of Saved Energy","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378778886900186","volume":9,"year":1986,"authors":[{"personalName":"ML","familyName":"Goldberg"},{"personalName":"MF","familyName":"Fels"}],"prettyTitle":"Refraction of PRISM Results...","prettyAuthors":"ML Goldberg et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Refraction of PRISM Results into Components of Saved Energy ML Goldberg MF Fels"},{"entryType":"misc","citationKey":"HMGovernment2009","entryTags":{"author":"HMGovernment","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2009/HMGovernment/2009 - HMGovernment - Investing in a Low Carbon Britain.pdf:pdf","keywords":"mCHP","mendeley-tags":"mCHP","publisher":"HM Government","title":"Investing in a Low Carbon Britain","year":2009,"authors":[{"familyName":"HMGovernment"}],"prettyTitle":"Investing in a Low Carbon...","prettyAuthors":"HMGovernment"},"fuzzyLabel":"Investing in a Low Carbon Britain undefined HMGovernment"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Shipworth2011","entryTags":{"author":"Shipworth, Michelle","doi":"10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.09.009","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2011/Shipworth/2011 - Shipworth - Thermostat settings in English houses No evidence of change between 1984 and 2007.pdf:pdf","issn":3601323,"journal":"Building and Environment","keywords":"household energy consumption","month":"March","number":3,"pages":"635--642","title":"Thermostat settings in English houses: No evidence of change between 1984 and 2007","url":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0360132310002799","volume":46,"year":2011,"authors":[{"personalName":"Michelle","familyName":"Shipworth"}],"prettyTitle":"Thermostat Settings in...","prettyAuthors":"Michelle Shipworth"},"fuzzyLabel":"Thermostat settings in English houses: No evidence of change between 1984 and 2007 Michelle Shipworth"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Gonzalez2005","entryTags":{"author":"Gonz\\'{a}lez, Pedro a. and Zamarre\\~{n}o, Jes\\'{u}s M.","doi":"10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.09.006","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2005/Gonz\\'{a}lez, Zamarre\\~{n}o/2005 - Gonz\\'{a}lez, Zamarre\\~{n}o - Prediction of hourly energy consumption in buildings based on a feedback artificial neural network.pdf:pdf","issn":3787788,"journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"energy demands and consumption,intelligent buildings,load forecasting,neural networks,optimization methods","month":"June","number":6,"pages":"595--601","title":"Prediction of hourly energy consumption in buildings based on a feedback artificial neural network","url":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378778804003032","volume":37,"year":2005,"authors":[{"personalName":"Pedro a.","familyName":"Gonz\\'{a}lez"},{"personalName":"Jes\\'{u}s M.","familyName":"Zamarre\\~{n}o"}],"prettyTitle":"Prediction of Hourly Energy...","prettyAuthors":"Pedro a.

We show how this approach can be used to study significant changes in dynamical systems due to a change in control parameters, chaos-order as well as chaos-chaos transitions. Finally we study and discuss climate transitions by analysing a marine proxy record for past sea surface temperature.

BREDEM-8 is a monthly calculation whereas BREDEM-12 works on a nominal heating season of 8 months. The BREDEM-8 results have been presented before but it is instructive to present them here again because this highlights the performance of the two versions of BREDEM relative to one another. Often all that is required of an energy calculation is a prediction of annual energy use. The results obtained indicate that in this respect the two versions of BREDEM are as good as the detailed simulation models. Both versions of BREDEM perform well in both types of test, and the predictions from the simpler seasonal calculation are as good as those from the more complex monthly calculation. This suggests that for many purposes, and in particular for those where a hand calculation option needs to be available, a seasonal calculation is quite adequate. For example, there is no point in basing an energy label such as the Standard Assessment Procedure on anything more complicated than a seasonal calculation. In situations where a computer would always be used to do the calculations, either a seasonal or a monthly calculation could be employed. The amount of data input is not significantly different in the two cases but the monthly calculation has the advantage that information on seasonal variations is available and this can be important, particularly for passive solar and low energy design purposes.","annote":"BREDEM 8 and 12 validation, but only on 19 dwellings.","author":"Dickson, C.M. and Dunster, J.E. and Lafferty, S.Z. and Shorrock, L.D.","doi":"10.1177/014362449601700306","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/1996/Dickson et al/1996 - Dickson et al. - BREDEM Testing monthly and seasonal versions against measurements and against detailed simulation models.pdf:pdf","issn":"0143-6244","journal":"Building Services Engineering Research and Technology","month":"January","number":3,"pages":"135--140","title":"BREDEM: Testing monthly and seasonal versions against measurements and against detailed simulation models","url":"http://bse.sagepub.com/content/17/3/135.refs","volume":17,"year":1996,"authors":[{"personalName":"C.M.","familyName":"Dickson"},{"personalName":"J.E.","familyName":"Dunster"},{"personalName":"S.Z.","familyName":"Lafferty"},{"personalName":"L.D.","familyName":"Shorrock"}],"prettyTitle":"BREDE...","prettyAuthors":"C.M.

Therefore we introduce a class of dynamical systems on contact manifolds, called conservative contact systems, defined as contact vector fields generated by some contact Hamiltonian function satisfying a compatibility condition with some Legendre submanifold of the contact manifold. Considering physical systems' modeling, the Legendre submanifold corresponds to the definition of the thermodynamical properties of the system and the contact Hamiltonian function corresponds to the definition of some irreversible processes taking place in the system. Open thermodynamical systems may also be modeled by augmenting the conservative contact systems with some input and output variables (in the sense of automatic control) and so-called input vector fields and lead to the definition of port contact systems. Finally complex systems consisting of coupled simple thermodynamical or mechanical systems may be represented by the composition of such port contact systems through algebraic relations called interconnection structure. Two examples illustrate this composition of contact systems: a gas under a piston submitted to some external force and the conduction of heat between two media with external thermostat. ?? 2007 Polish Scientific Publishers PWN, Warszawa.","author":"Eberard, D. and Maschke, B.

Finally, firm productivity correlates positively with a higher innovation output, even when controlling for the skill composition of labor as well as for physical capital intensity.","author":"Crepon, Bruno and Duguet, Emmanuel and Mairessec, Jacques","doi":"10.1080/10438599800000031","issn":"1043-8599","journal":"Economics of Innovation and New Technology","month":"January","number":2,"pages":"115--158","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Research, Innovation And Productivi[Ty: An Econometric Analysis At The Firm Level","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10438599800000031","volume":7,"year":1998,"authors":[{"personalName":"Bruno","familyName":"Crepon"},{"personalName":"Emmanuel","familyName":"Duguet"},{"personalName":"Jacques","familyName":"Mairessec"}],"prettyTitle":"Research, Innovation and...","prettyAuthors":"Bruno Crepon et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Research, Innovation And Productivi[Ty: An Econometric Analysis At The Firm Level Bruno Crepon Emmanuel Duguet Jacques Mairessec"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Heo2012","entryTags":{"abstract":"Retrofitting existing buildings is urgent given the increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of the existing building stock. This paper presents a scalable, probabilistic methodology that can support large scale investments in energy retrofit of buildings while accounting for uncertainty. The methodology is based on Bayesian calibration of normative energy models. Based on CEN-ISO standards, normative energy models are light-weight, quasi-steady state formulations of heat balance equations, which makes them appropriate for modeling large sets of buildings efficiently. Calibration of these models enables improved representation of the actual buildings and quantification of uncertainties associated with model parameters. In addition, the calibrated models can incorporate additional uncertainties coming from retrofit interventions to generate probabilistic predictions of retrofit performance. Probabilistic outputs can be straightforwardly translated to quantify risks of under-performance associated with retrofit interventions. A case study demonstrates that the proposed methodology with the use of normative models can correctly evaluate energy retrofit options and support risk conscious decision-making by explicitly inspecting risks associated with each retrofit option.","author":"Heo, Y. and Choudhary, R. and Augenbroe, G.A.","doi":"10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.12.029","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2012/Heo, Choudhary, Augenbroe/2012 - Heo, Choudhary, Augenbroe - Calibration of building energy models for retrofit analysis under uncertainty.pdf:pdf","issn":3787788,"journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"Bayesian calibration,Normative energy models,Retrofit analysis,Uncertainty analysis","month":"April","pages":"550--560","title":"Calibration of building energy models for retrofit analysis under uncertainty","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877881100644X","volume":47,"year":2012,"authors":[{"personalName":"Y.","familyName":"Heo"},{"personalName":"R.","familyName":"Choudhary"},{"personalName":"G.A.","familyName":"Augenbroe"}],"prettyTitle":"Calibration of Building...","prettyAuthors":"Y.

It is increasingly recognized that these actions may also have near-term effects on health arising from changes to the indoor environment.

Here we provide details of the elements of our model that address the relationships between the fabric and ventilation improvements and changes in indoor temperature during the heating season – the ‘temperature take back factor’. We demonstrate that the scale of these interventions is consistent with the emission reductions proposed by the UK Climate Change Committee, and estimate that, in the UK the consequent reduction in exposure to indoor cold may result in around 4400 fewer disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) each year.

The paper uses a decomposition approach to investigate differences in residential energy demand structure and end-use intensities and discusses both differences in absolute levels of energy use and differences over time. Comparisons are also made to other countries that have been analysed in the IEA energy efficiency indicator project. The analysis shows that, in contrast to Denmark and Sweden, Norway saw a growth in total residential energy use between 1973 and 1999. This can be partially explained by the fact that Norway started from a lower per capita income level in the early 1970s but has since then enjoyed a rapid income growth that drove up house area and consequently put a pressure on energy use. But the analysis also shows that Denmark and Sweden achieved significant reductions of residential energy intensities between 1973 and 1990, while the reductions in Norway were negligible. After 1990, the picture changed; there was a strong decline in residential energy intensities in Norway and a high rate of energy savings compared to most other countries analysed by the IEA, while energy savings in Denmark and Sweden more or less came to a halt.","author":"Unander, Fridtjof and Ettest\\o l, Ingunn and Ting, Mike and Schipper, Lee","doi":"10.1016/S0301-4215(03)00106-X","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2004/Unander et al/2004 - Unander et al. - Residential energy use an international perspective on long-term trends in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.pdf:pdf","issn":3014215,"journal":"Energy Policy","keywords":"Energy indicators,Residential,Scandinavia","month":"August","number":12,"pages":"1395--1404","title":"Residential energy use: an international perspective on long-term trends in Denmark, Norway and Sweden","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142150300106X","volume":32,"year":2004,"authors":[{"personalName":"Fridtjof","familyName":"Unander"},{"personalName":"Ingunn","familyName":"Ettest\\o l"},{"personalName":"Mike","familyName":"Ting"},{"personalName":"Lee","familyName":"Schipper"}],"prettyTitle":"Residential Energy...","prettyAuthors":"Fridtjof Unander et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Residential energy use: an international perspective on long-term trends in Denmark, Norway and Sweden Fridtjof Unander Ingunn Ettest\\o l Mike Ting Lee Schipper"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Anderson2009","entryTags":{"abstract":"The national roll-out of smart meters is an opportunity to improve consumer information on energy use through the integration of home energy displays with the smart meter technology.

The study recruited a total of 38 participants to five demographically differentiated focus groups, each of which met twice. At the first meeting, each group designed an ideal home energy display based on participants' ideas of what they thought such a display ought to include. Participants then spent a week using existing models at home. At the second meeting, the groups reviewed their experience and revised their designs accordingly. The study found remarkable convergence in the groups' final designs, enabling the clear specification of a core set of features and functionality for home energy displays. Only one of the displays used in the study, the GEO minim, comes close to meeting this specification. Despite a relatively well developed display industry in the UK, the majority of the home energy displays currently on the market do not have the functionality that consumers identify, in practice, as being critical to display design.

Studies have shown that occupant behaviour might play a prominent role in the variation in energy consumption in different households but the extent of such influence is unknown. The impact of the building's thermal characteristics on space heating demand has been well studied. There is however, little work done that incorporates the impact of consumer behaviour. This study aims to gain greater insight into the effect of occupant behaviour on energy consumption for space heating by determining its effect on the variation of energy consumption in dwellings while controlling for building characteristics. The KWR database from the Ministry of Housing in the Netherlands was used. This study showed that occupant characteristics and behaviour significantly affect energy use (4.2\\%), but building characteristics still determine a large part of the energy use in a dwelling (42\\%). Further analysis showed that some occupant behaviour is determined by the type of dwelling or HVAC systems and, therefore, the effect of occupant characteristics might be larger than expected, since these determine the type of dwelling.","author":"{Guerra Santin}, Olivia and Itard, Laure and Visscher, Henk","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2009/Guerra Santin, Itard, Visscher/2009 - Guerra Santin, Itard, Visscher - The effect of occupancy and building characteristics on energy use for space and water heating i.pdf:pdf","journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"Building regulations,Energy for space heating,Occupant behaviour,Residential stock","number":11,"pages":"1223--1232","title":"The effect of occupancy and building characteristics on energy use for space and water heating in Dutch residential stock","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778809001388","volume":41,"year":2009,"authors":[{"personalName":"Olivia","familyName":"{Guerra Santin}"},{"personalName":"Laure","familyName":"Itard"},{"personalName":"Henk","familyName":"Visscher"}],"prettyTitle":"The Effect of Occupancy and...","prettyAuthors":"Olivia {Guerra Santin et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"The effect of occupancy and building characteristics on energy use for space and water heating in Dutch residential stock Olivia {Guerra Santin} Laure Itard Henk Visscher"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Rabiner1989a","entryTags":{"author":"Rabiner, L","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/1989/Rabiner/1989 - Rabiner - A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in Speech Recognition.pdf:pdf","journal":"Proceedings of the IEEE","title":"A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in Speech Recognition","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs\\_all.jsp?arnumber=18626","year":1989,"authors":[{"personalName":"L","familyName":"Rabiner"}],"prettyTitle":"A Tutorial on Hidden Markov...","prettyAuthors":"L Rabiner"},"fuzzyLabel":"A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in Speech Recognition L Rabiner"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Piacenza2004","entryTags":{"abstract":"The paper investigates the cost properties of a sample of Italian utilities providing in combination gas, water and electricity services.

Meteorological data was obtained from the Danish Meteorological Institute. Four control mechanisms (window open/closed, heating on/off, lighting on/off and solar shading in/not in use) were analysed separately by means of multiple logistic regression in order to quantify factors influencing occupants’ behaviour. The window opening behaviour was strongly related to the outdoor temperature. The perception of the environment and factors concerning the dwelling also impacted the window opening behaviour. The proportion of dwellings with the heating turned on was strongly related to the outdoor temperature and the presence of a wood burning stove. The solar radiation, dwelling ownership conditions and the perception of the indoor environment also affected the use of heating. The results of the statistical analyses form a basis for a definition of standard behaviour patterns which can be used to make calculation of energy consumption of buildings more accurate.","author":"Andersen, Rune Vinther and Toftum, J\\o rn and Andersen, Klaus Kaae and Olesen, Bjarne W.","doi":"10.1016/j.enbuild.2008.07.004","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2009/Andersen et al/2009 - Andersen et al. - Survey of occupant behaviour and control of indoor environment in Danish dwellings.pdf:pdf","issn":3787788,"journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"Energy,Heating control,Indoor environment,Light control,Occupant behaviour,Questionnaire survey,Solar shading control,Window opening","month":"January","number":1,"pages":"11--16","title":"Survey of occupant behaviour and control of indoor environment in Danish dwellings","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778808001655","volume":41,"year":2009,"authors":[{"personalName":"Rune Vinther","familyName":"Andersen"},{"personalName":"J\\o rn","familyName":"Toftum"},{"personalName":"Klaus Kaae","familyName":"Andersen"},{"personalName":"Bjarne W.","familyName":"Olesen"}],"prettyTitle":"Survey of Occupant Behaviour...","prettyAuthors":"Rune Vinther Andersen et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Survey of occupant behaviour and control of indoor environment in Danish dwellings Rune Vinther Andersen J\\o rn Toftum Klaus Kaae Andersen Bjarne W.

Designed in the days of mainframe computers, expanding their capabilities further has become difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. At the same time, the 30 years have seen significant advances in analysis and computational methods and power — providing an opportunity for significant improvement in these tools. In 1996, a US federal agency began developing a new building energy simulation tool, EnergyPlus, building on development experience with two existing programs: DOE-2 and BLAST. EnergyPlus includes a number of innovative simulation features — such as variable time steps, user-configurable modular systems that are integrated with a heat and mass balance-based zone simulation — and input and output data structures tailored to facilitate third party module and interface development. Other planned simulation capabilities include multizone airflow, and electric power and solar thermal and photovoltaic simulation.

It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity. We close with some suggestions for future work.","author":"Ladyman, James and Lambert, James and Wiesner, Karoline","doi":"10.1007/s13194-012-0056-8","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2012/Ladyman, Lambert, Wiesner/2012 - Ladyman, Lambert, Wiesner - What is a complex system.pdf:pdf","isbn":1319401200568,"issn":"1879-4912","journal":"European Journal for Philosophy of Science","title":"What is a complex system?","year":2012,"authors":[{"personalName":"James","familyName":"Ladyman"},{"personalName":"James","familyName":"Lambert"},{"personalName":"Karoline","familyName":"Wiesner"}],"prettyTitle":"What Is a Complex...","prettyAuthors":"James Ladyman et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"What is a complex system?

On the other hand, in summer, walls and roofs exposed to incident solar radiation usually require shading to avoid too much solar gain. Data on solar energy availability are crucial for good building design. However, it is important how the availability of solar radiation is determined. An important aim of the paper presented is to give some results of a comparative analysis of two basic sky models, isotropic: Hottel–Woertz–Liu–Jordan and anisotropic: the HDKR, Hay–Davies–Klucher–Reindl, to recommend one of these models for determination of solar energy availability on a building envelope and to formulate the energy balance of a building. Differences between results obtained from both models increase with the slope of exposed surfaces. The biggest differences (12–15\\%) are evident for vertical south surfaces, especially in summer. The simplified isotropic sky model is not recommended for evaluation of solar radiation availability on the building envelope. Underestimation of solar gains can lead to the selection of an unsuitable concept and construction of a building and result in poor indoor thermal comfort, i.e. overheating of rooms in summer.","author":"Chwieduk, Dorota A.","doi":"10.1016/j.renene.2008.04.005","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2009/Chwieduk/2009 - Chwieduk - Recommendation on modelling of solar energy incident on a building envelope.pdf:pdf","issn":9601481,"journal":"Renewable Energy","keywords":"Anisotropic sky model,Isotropic sky model,Solar energy availability,Solar irradiation on building envelope","month":"March","number":3,"pages":"736--741","title":"Recommendation on modelling of solar energy incident on a building envelope","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148108001766","volume":34,"year":2009,"authors":[{"personalName":"Dorota A.","familyName":"Chwieduk"}],"prettyTitle":"Recommendation on Modelling...","prettyAuthors":"Dorota A.

Using an ‘actor oriented approach’, the paper tries to identify (a) the drivers and barriers that affect the success or failure of energy efficiency investments and (b) the institutions that are responsible for the emergence of these barriers and drivers. This taxonomy aims to synthesise ideas from three broad perspectives, viz., micro (project/end user), meso (organization), and macro (state, market, civil society). The paper develops a systematic framework by looking at the issues from the perspective of different actors. This not only aids the understanding of barriers and drivers; it also provides scope for appropriate policy interventions. This focus will help policy-makers evaluate to what extent future interventions may be warranted and how one can judge the success of particular interventions.","annote":"Systematic study of barriers - fincance, legal, organizational, informational...","author":"{Sudhakara Reddy}, B.","doi":"10.1016/j.enconman.2013.06.040","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2013/Sudhakara Reddy/2013 - Sudhakara Reddy - Barriers and drivers to energy efficiency – A new taxonomical approach.pdf:pdf","issn":1968904,"journal":"Energy Conversion and Management","keywords":"Actor,Barrier,Driver,Efficiency,Taxonomy","month":"October","pages":"403--416","title":"Barriers and drivers to energy efficiency – A new taxonomical approach","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019689041300352X","volume":74,"year":2013,"authors":[{"personalName":"B.","familyName":"{Sudhakara Reddy}"}],"prettyTitle":"Barriers and Drivers to...","prettyAuthors":"B. {Sudhakara Reddy"},"fuzzyLabel":"Barriers and drivers to energy efficiency – A new taxonomical approach B. {Sudhakara Reddy}"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Costa2010","entryTags":{"author":"Costa, Kevin D and Kleinstein, Steven and Hershberg, Uri","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2010/Costa, Kleinstein, Hershberg/2010 - Costa, Kleinstein, Hershberg - Model Fitting and Error Estimation Biomathematical Model.pdf:pdf","journal":"Spring","title":"Model Fitting and Error Estimation Biomathematical Model","year":2010,"authors":[{"personalName":"Kevin D","familyName":"Costa"},{"personalName":"Steven","familyName":"Kleinstein"},{"personalName":"Uri","familyName":"Hershberg"}],"prettyTitle":"Model Fitting and Error...","prettyAuthors":"Kevin D Costa et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Model Fitting and Error Estimation Biomathematical Model Kevin D Costa Steven Kleinstein Uri Hershberg"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Trejo-Perea2009","entryTags":{"author":"Trejo-Perea, M and Herrera-Ruiz, G","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2009/Trejo-Perea, Herrera-Ruiz/2009 - Trejo-Perea, Herrera-Ruiz - Greenhouse energy consumption prediction using neural networks models.pdf:pdf","journal":"International Journal of Agriculture and Biology","keywords":"anova,artificial neural network,energy consumption prediction,greenhouse","pages":"1--6","title":"Greenhouse energy consumption prediction using neural networks models","url":"http://fspublishers.org/images1/64173\\_..pdf","year":2009,"authors":[{"personalName":"M","familyName":"Trejo-Perea"},{"personalName":"G","familyName":"Herrera-Ruiz"}],"prettyTitle":"Greenhouse Energy Consumption...","prettyAuthors":"M Trejo-Perea et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Greenhouse energy consumption prediction using neural networks models M Trejo-Perea G Herrera-Ruiz"},{"entryType":"misc","citationKey":"Shipworth2013","entryTags":{"address":"London","author":"Shipworth, Michelle","publisher":"UCL Energy Institute","title":"personal communication","year":2013,"authors":[{"personalName":"Michelle","familyName":"Shipworth"}],"prettyTitle":"Personal...","prettyAuthors":"Michelle Shipworth"},"fuzzyLabel":"personal communication Michelle Shipworth"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Kelly2011","entryTags":{"abstract":"Energy consumption from the residential sector is a complex socio-technical problem that can be explained using a combination of physical, demographic and behavioural characteristics of a dwelling and its occupants. A structural equation model (SEM) is introduced to calculate the magnitude and significance of explanatory variables on residential energy consumption. The benefit of this approach is that it explains the complex relationships that exist between manifest variables and their overall effect though direct, indirect and total effects. Using the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) consisting of 2531 unique cases, the main drivers behind residential energy consumption are found to be the number of household occupants, floor area, household income, dwelling efficiency (SAP), household heating patterns and living room temperature. In the multivariate case, SAP explains very little of the variance of residential energy consumption. However, this procedure fails to account for simultaneity bias between energy consumption and SAP. Using SEM its shown that dwelling energy efficiency (SAP), has reciprocal causality with dwelling energy consumption and the magnitude of these two effects are calculable. When non-recursivity between SAP and energy consumption is allowed for, SAP is shown to have a negative effect on energy consumption but conversely, homes with a propensity to consume more energy also have higher SAP rates.","author":"Kelly, Scott","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2011/Kelly/2011 - Kelly - Do homes that are more energy efficient consume less energy A structural equation model of the English residential sector.pdf:pdf","journal":"Energy","keywords":"Efficiency,Energy,Equation,Modelling,Residential,Structural","number":9,"pages":"5610--5620","title":"Do homes that are more energy efficient consume less energy?: A structural equation model of the English residential sector","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544211004579","volume":36,"year":2011,"authors":[{"personalName":"Scott","familyName":"Kelly"}],"prettyTitle":"Do Homes That Are More Energy...","prettyAuthors":"Scott Kelly"},"fuzzyLabel":"Do homes that are more energy efficient consume less energy?: A structural equation model of the English residential sector Scott Kelly"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Rylatt2003","entryTags":{"abstract":"This paper reviews existing bottom-up approaches to the urban scale prediction of domestic energy demand and introduces a new approach based on Geographical Information Systems (GIS). It describes how software tools can be used to derive predictors from the plan form of dwellings extracted from digital maps and, using a new default-data system, to satisfy the large data requirements of an embedded version of the BREDEM-8 domestic energy model. Energy consumption and CO2emissions of urban dwellings can be predicted quickly and robustly without costly on-site measurements or statistically derived geometrical models. Urban areas of almost arbitrary size can be modelled and accuracy can be incrementally improved with additional data. The model is validated by comparison with results produced by the UK's National Home Energy Rating scheme software using complete site-surveyed datasets. Its ability to rapidly estimate energy demand is demonstrated for around 400 dwellings in Leicester, UK using only the dwelling age, the default data system and the GIS tools.","author":"Rylatt, RM and Gadsden, SJ and Lomas, KJ","doi":"10.1191/0143624403bt061oa","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2003/Rylatt, Gadsden, Lomas/2003 - Rylatt, Gadsden, Lomas - Methods of predicting urban domestic energy demand with reduced datasets a review and a new GIS-based ap.pdf:pdf","issn":14770849,"journal":"Building Services Engineering Research and Technology","keywords":"review","mendeley-tags":"review","month":"June","number":2,"pages":"93--102","title":"Methods of predicting urban domestic energy demand with reduced datasets: a review and a new GIS-based approach","url":"http://bse.sagepub.com/content/24/2/93.abstract?patientinform-links=yes\\&legid=spbse;24/2/93","volume":24,"year":2003,"authors":[{"personalName":"RM","familyName":"Rylatt"},{"personalName":"SJ","familyName":"Gadsden"},{"personalName":"KJ","familyName":"Lomas"}],"prettyTitle":"Methods of Predicting Urban...","prettyAuthors":"RM Rylatt et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Methods of predicting urban domestic energy demand with reduced datasets: a review and a new GIS-based approach RM Rylatt SJ Gadsden KJ Lomas"},{"entryType":"techreport","citationKey":"DECC2014c","entryTags":{"author":"DECC","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2014/DECC/2014 - DECC - Smart Metering Implementation Programme Smart Metering Equipment Technical Specifications.pdf:pdf","institution":"DECC","number":"July","pages":"1--126","title":"Smart Metering Implementation Programme Smart Metering Equipment Technical Specifications","year":2014,"authors":[{"familyName":"DECC"}],"prettyTitle":"Smart Metering Implementation...","prettyAuthors":"DECC"},"fuzzyLabel":"Smart Metering Implementation Programme Smart Metering Equipment Technical Specifications undefined DECC"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Wiedermann2013","entryTags":{"abstract":"Many real-world complex systems are adequately represented by networks of interacting or\n interdependent networks.

It was designed to consume a minimum amount of thermal energy by combining several renewable energy systems (1400m2 of solar roof, buried pipe and exhausted air heat exchangers) with an optimised envelope and electrical equipment. Initially predicted to consume 160MJ/m2 per year of gas, a gas energy use index (per unit heated floor area) of 246MJ/m2 per year was measured. The energy analysis of the building, based on a 3-year period of monitoring, brought up the most relevant points that explain this difference: the real conditions of utilisation (such as the interior temperature) and the real performance of the complete technical system are not taken into account in the theoretical value. Both technical and economical aspects of the renewable energy systems were analysed in detail. An important lesson learned from this experiment is that the energy concept of buildings must be simple and consistent and the complexity of the technical installations must be carefully managed from the design-stage to the exploitation. Detailed monitoring of innovative low-energy buildings is recommended to understand the possible discrepancies between theoretical and real heat consumption and to improve the transfer of new energy technologies to large-scale real constructions.","author":"Branco, G and Lachal, B and Gallinelli, P and Weber, W","doi":"10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.01.028","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/2004/Branco et al/2004 - Branco et al. - Predicted versus observed heat consumption of a low energy multifamily complex in Switzerland based on long-term.pdf:pdf","issn":3787788,"journal":"Energy and Buildings","keywords":"Experimental analysis,Gas energy use index,Low energy building,Solar roof,Technical and economical evaluation","month":"June","number":6,"pages":"543--555","title":"Predicted versus observed heat consumption of a low energy multifamily complex in Switzerland based on long-term experimental data","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778804000696","volume":36,"year":2004,"authors":[{"personalName":"G","familyName":"Branco"},{"personalName":"B","familyName":"Lachal"},{"personalName":"P","familyName":"Gallinelli"},{"personalName":"W","familyName":"Weber"}],"prettyTitle":"Predicted Versus Observed...","prettyAuthors":"G Branco et al."},"fuzzyLabel":"Predicted versus observed heat consumption of a low energy multifamily complex in Switzerland based on long-term experimental data G Branco B Lachal P Gallinelli W Weber"},{"entryType":"article","citationKey":"Shipworth","entryTags":{"author":"Shipworth, David","file":":Users/jonathanchambers/Documents/Papers/Unknown/Shipworth/Unknown - Shipworth - Conceptualising and modelling energy practices using random field methods What do practices do to energy power.pdf:pdf","title":"Conceptualising and modelling energy practices using random field methods What do practices do to energy / power ?","authors":[{"personalName":"David","familyName":"Shipworth"}],"prettyTitle":"Conceptualising and Modelling...","prettyAuthors":"David Shipworth"},"fuzzyLabel":"Conceptualising and modelling energy practices using random field methods What do practices do to energy / power ?

With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS \"This is a vast and complex book.
